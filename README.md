# Image Recursive Optimizer

### Description
 This package i made as a solution for a problem i had on a blog website i've worked on, we had **lots** of images that was eating the storage on the server. we wanted to reduce the size of all the images while keeping the file names and folders structure the same, so i made this simple solution and yes, it saved us a lot of gigabytes.
 
 ### Usage
 Just pass the folder name in query string parameter **path** `?path=foo` and it will create a folder called **optimized** that will contain your optimized version of the images folder
